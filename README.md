# Cybersafe
App made to educate people about cybersecurity and internet safety.

**[please open the app on an Iphone 11 if you have Xcode!]**

What to expect:
When opening the app, the loading screen appears and a few seconds later, the user is lead to the home page or the main screen. 
From there, there are 3 buttons made so far that are filled with information from cybersecurity to understanding what passwords are strong!

What tools were used: Xcode, Swift, Google, Canva for design of thumbnail, my 2 AM brain heh

Why was this app made?
- I made this app to inform fellow students of mine or people of all ages on internet safety and basic information on what cybersecurity is.

Why is it called Cybersafe?
- The name is a combination of the words "Cybersecurity" and "Safe" so mashed together equals "Cybersafe" ! :D

Hours: 5+ hrs <- many breaks in between because this weekend busy!
